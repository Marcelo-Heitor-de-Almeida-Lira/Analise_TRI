Okay, I need to generate a quality report for this question based on the given data. Let me start by understanding the structure and what each part requires.

First, looking at the HTML model provided, it has several sections: an introduction, data about the item, distribution of answers, interpretations, and recommendations. The user emphasized following this structure closely, so I have to make sure I don't miss any parts.

The data given includes difficulty level, classification, probability of guessing, discrimination index, total responses, and breakdowns for students above and below the difficulty level, along with their performance. There's also information on answer distribution across options A-E and null responses.

I'll start by inserting the difficulty and classification. The difficulty is 692.95, which falls into the 'Difícil' category since it's between 651.0 and 727.0. So I'll mention that in the item data section. Next, the probability of guessing is 20.03%, which makes sense because with five options, a random guess has a 20% chance.

The discrimination index is 2.030. Hmm, I remember that higher discrimination values indicate better differentiation between students who know the material and those who don't. So this value seems good, but maybe it's slightly lower than ideal? Or perhaps it's acceptable. I'll note that in the interpretations.

Looking at the total responses: 6275. That’s a large number, so the data should be reliable. Now, breaking down the students into above and below difficulty levels:

- Students above difficulty: 17.45% of total.
   - Acertos: 14.07%
   - Erros: 3.38%

Wait, that's interesting. Usually, if a question is difficult, we'd expect higher accuracy from students above the level. But here, only about 14% acerto? That seems low. Maybe there's an issue with the item.

- Students below difficulty: 82.55%
   - Acertos: 25.21%
   - Erros: 57.43%

Hmm, this is even more confusing. A higher percentage of students with lower ability are getting 25% right? That's better than expected if the question is difficult. Normally, weaker students would perform worse. So this seems like a problem because the question isn't distinguishing effectively between high and low ability students.

Now, looking at answer distribution:
- A:13.20%
- B:9.97%
- C:19.11%
- D:39.21% (gab)
- E:17.93%

D is the correct answer and has the highest percentage at 39%, which is good because it's the intended choice. However, C is close with 19%, so maybe some confusion there. The others are lower, but A and B have relatively low percentages. E is 17.93%, which isn't too bad.

In the interpretations section, I should highlight that students above the difficulty level aren't performing as expected—they're getting only about 14% correct, which is worse than those below who got 25%. This suggests poor discrimination because it's not separating the groups effectively. The answer distribution looks okay since D is the most chosen, but the low performance by higher ability students is concerning.

For recommendations, I think the item needs to be reviewed because the difficulty might be misaligned with intended classification or there are issues in how questions are structured, leading to unexpected responses. It's crucial for maintaining test quality to address this.

  <h1><b>Relatório de Análise Item</b></h1>
  <h2><b>Dados do Item</b></h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Dificuldade Estimada do Item: {692.95} (200 - 1.000). É considerada uma questão Difícil</li>
   <li>Probabilidade de chute: 20.03%</li>
   <li>Discriminação do Item: 2.030</li>
   <li>Gabarito: D</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Distribuição das respostas</h2>

  <h2>Interpretações dos Resultados</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A questão apresenta uma boa discriminação (2.030), indicando que alunos com habilidade superior à dificuldade do item tiveram um desempenho ligeiramente melhor que aqueles com habilidade inferior.</li>
    <li>Os alunos com habilidade acima da dificuldade do item apresentaram uma taxa de acerto (14.07%) menor do que o esperado, indicando que a questão pode estar mais difícil do que previsto ou há problemas na compreensão das alternativas.</li>
    <li>Os alunos com habilidade abaixo da dificuldade do item tiveram uma taxa de acerto (25.21%) superior à taxa de erros (57.43%), o que é inesperado para uma questão classificada como difícil. Isso pode indicar problemas na validade da questão.</li>
    <li>A distribuição das respostas mostra que a opção correta (D) foi a mais escolhida (39.21%), seguida pela opção C (19.11%). As outras alternativas tiveram menos de 20% cada, o que sugere que a questão teve uma boa discriminação, mas ainda há espaço para melhorias na clareza das alternativas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recomendações</h2>
  <p>Considerar revisar o item devido à baixa taxa de acerto dos alunos com habilidade superior e à alta taxa de acerto dos alunos com habilidade inferior. Além disso, recomenda-se verificar se a dificuldade estimada (692.95) está alinhada com a classificação "Difícil" e analisar as alternativas para identificar possíveis fontes de confusão.</p>
